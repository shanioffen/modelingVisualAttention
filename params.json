{"name":"Modeling Visual Attention: Spatial frequency and the Central Performance Drop","tagline":"Adding spatial frequency tuning to the Reynolds-Heeger normalization model of attention","body":"There is physiological and psychophysical evidence that attention might increase spatial resolution at the attended location.\r\n\r\nPerformance on visual search tasks using textures composed of oriented lines was impaired by exogenous attention to foveal locations. One explanation for this finding is that performance on these visual search tasks is dependent on a match between the spatial frequency of the target and the spatial frequency tuning of the neural population serving the spatial location of the target. Because foveal regions are served by populations of neurons tuned to higher frequencies, performance on tasks using lower-frequency stimuli will be worse when the target is presented at foveal rather than at mid-peripheral locations.\r\n\r\nEvidence that a SF match is critical comes from the observation that there is a central performance drop (CPD) observed on tasks using stimuli at mid-range spatial frequencies (in the absence of an attentional manipulation). Exogenous attention has been shown to shift this CPD farther to the periphery. This observation is consistent with the theory that exogenous attention increases spatial resolution at the attended location. By contrast, endogenous attention improved performance at all eccentricities.\r\n\r\nWe are testing this theory using the Reynolds-Heeger normalization model of attention. We have expanded the original model to include spatial frequency in addition to spatial location and orientation. To calculate the excitatory drive (the numerator for the normalization equation), the input stimulus was decomposed into spatial frequency and orientation bands using a set of quadrature pair filters tuned to different orientations and spatial frequencies. Early modeling results have established that replicating the CPD requires the model to have broader SF input to the inhibitory drive (the denominator of the normalization equation) as compared with the input to the excitatory drive.\r\n\r\nThe model replicates the effects of attention that have been observed psychophysically. In addition to the shift of the CPD with exogenous attention, a series of studies on visual attention has suggested that the attentional effect is achieved by modulating the response properties of the highest spatial frequency channels in a given neuronal population. We seek to replicate the full range of findings, and to offer suggestions as to how endogenous attention might operate differently from exogenous attention. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
